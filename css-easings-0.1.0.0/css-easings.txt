@version 0.1.0.0

module Css.Easing

-- | A type that describes the different types of css-easings (also known
--   as "transition timing functions"). There are basically two modes:
--   <a>Steps</a> and <a>CubicBezier</a>s.
data Easing

-- | Displays the transition along n stops along the transition, displaying
--   each stop for equal lengths of time. For example, if n is 5, there are
--   5 steps. Whether the transition holds temporarily at 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%
--   and 80%, on the 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%, or makes 5 stops between
--   the 0% and 100% along the transition, or makes 5 stops including the
--   0% and 100% marks (on the 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) depends on
--   which of the <a>JumpTerm</a> is used.
Steps :: Int -> JumpTerm -> Easing

-- | An author defined cubic-Bezier curve, where the p1 and p3 values must
--   be in the range of 0 to 1.
CubicBezier :: Scientific -> Scientific -> Scientific -> Scientific -> Easing

-- | Constructs a <a>Steps</a> given the first item is strictly greater
--   than zero. If that is the case, it returns the <a>Easing</a> wrapped
--   in a <a>Just</a>, otherwise a <a>Nothing</a> is returned.
steps :: Int -> JumpTerm -> Maybe Easing

-- | Construct a <a>Steps</a> given the first item is strictly greater than
--   ero. If that is the case, it returns the <a>Easing</a> object,
--   otherwise it will raise an error.
steps' :: Int -> JumpTerm -> Easing

-- | Constructs a <a>CubicBezier</a> given that the first and third value
--   are between <tt>0.0</tt> and <tt>1.0</tt>. If that is the case, it
--   returns a <a>Just</a> that wraps the <a>Easing</a>. Otherwise
--   <a>Nothing</a> is returned.
cubicBezier :: Scientific -> Scientific -> Scientific -> Scientific -> Maybe Easing

-- | Constructs a <a>CubicBezier</a> given the first and third value are
--   between <tt>0.0</tt> and <tt>1.0</tt>. If this is the case, it returns
--   that <a>Easing</a>, otherwise it will raise an error.
cubicBezier' :: Scientific -> Scientific -> Scientific -> Scientific -> Easing

-- | A type that is used to describe how the jumps are done in a
--   <a>Steps</a> construction.
data JumpTerm

-- | In css this is denoted as <tt>jump-start</tt>. This denotes a
--   left-continuous function, so that the first jump happens when the
--   transition begins.
JumpStart :: JumpTerm

-- | In css this is denoted as <tt>jump-end</tt>. Denotes a
--   right-continuous function, so that the last jump happens when the
--   animation ends.
JumpEnd :: JumpTerm

-- | In css this is denoted as <tt>jump-none</tt>. There is no jump on
--   either end. Instead, holding at both the 0% mark and the 100% mark,
--   each for 1/n of the duration.
JumpNone :: JumpTerm

-- | In css this is denoted as <tt>jump-both</tt>. Includes pauses at both
--   the 0% and 100% marks, effectively adding a step during the transition
--   time.
